This is the website used in the development of the C0 Language's tutorial wiki. The C0 Language, and this wiki, are maintained by [Frank Pfenning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/). 

There's nothing to see here, you probably want to go to the [tutorial](https://github.com/frankpfenning/C0-Tutorial/wiki).

The wiki is itself a Git repository; if you want to use GitHub's repository-viewing tools to view the wiki's repository, you can look at Rob's [fork](https://github.com/robsimmons/C0-Tutorial), though this may not be kept entirely in synch with the master wiki.
